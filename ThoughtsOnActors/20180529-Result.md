The module `Actors.Result` contains an implementation for an actor type alias
and then a number of functions that can be used to create specific actor results
and to then manipulate these results.

The type alias for `Actors.Result.Result` is defined as follows:

``` haskell
type alias Result a b =
  [|
    okay : b
  , error : a
  |]
```

This is interpreted as

> Any actor that accepts an okay or error message can play the role of a Result

The first actor is a result sink.  This actor can play the role of a result but
it will just swallow the `okay` or `error` messages.

``` haskell
sink : Result a b
sink =
  [|
    okay self s value =
      ( s, Actors.none )

  , error self s value =
      ( s, Actors.none )
  |]
```

A couple of things to notice:

- Only a single instance of the sink value will exist within a single system
