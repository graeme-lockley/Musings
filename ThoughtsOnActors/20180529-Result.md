The module `Actors.Result` contains an implementation for an actor type alias and then a number of functions that can be used to create specific actor results and to then manipulate these results.

The type alias for `Actors.Result.Result` is defined as follows:

``` haskell
type alias Result a b =
  [|
    okay : b
  , error : a
  |]
```

This is interpreted as

> Any actor that accepts an okay or error message can play the role of a Result

## Actors.Result.sink

The first actor is a result sink.  This actor can play the role of a result but it will just swallow the `okay` or `error` messages.

``` haskell
sink : Result a b
sink =
  [|
    okay self value s =
      ( s, Actors.none )

  , error self value s =
      ( s, Actors.none )
  |]
```

A couple of things worth noting:

- Only a single instance of this sink value will exist within a running system, and
- Although a `sink` might not seem particularly useful it is used where an actor wishes to perform an action and does need anything to be done with the result - whether or not the action was successful or not.  As illustrated below an actor, using `System.IO.FileSystem.unlink`, is able to remove *README.md* and ignore the result.

```haskell
import System.IO.FileSystem as FS

FS.unlink "README.md" Actors.Result.sink
```


## Actors.Result.map

A useful actor is a result actor which is able to transform the okay value based on a passed function.

```haskell
map : (b -> c) -> Result a b -> Result a c
map f result =
  [|
    okay self value s =
      ( s, result.okay <| f value )

  , error self value s =
      ( s, Actors.none )
  |]
```

To illustrate how this actor can be used consider the actor `System.IO.FileSystem.stat` which requires a file name and an actor supporting `Actors.Result.Result FS.Error FS.Stats`.  A value supporting `FS.Stats` can be interrogated using `FS.directory?` to determine whether or not the associated file is a directory or not.

This can now be wrapped into a new function called `isDirectory` which will return a `Msg` when passed a file name and an actor supporting `Actors.Result.Result FS.Error Bool`:

```haskell
import System.IO.FileSystem as FS

isDirectory : String -> Actors.Result.Result FS.Error Bool -> Msg
isDirectory name result =
    FS.stat name
      <| Actors.Result.map (\stats -> FS.isDirectory stats) result
```


## Actors.Result.all


``` haskell
alln : Int -> Actors.Result.Result a b -> Actors.Result.Result a (List b)
alln n result =
  [|
    init =
      ( Just []
      , Actors.none
      )

  , okay self value s =
      case s of
        Just items ->
          if List.length items == n - 1 then
            ( items = Nothing
            , result.okay <| value : items
            )
          else
            ( value : items
            , Actors.none
            )

        Nothing ->
          ( s, Actors.none )

  , error self value s =
      case s of
        Just items ->
          ( items = Nothing
          , result.error value
          )

        Nothing ->
          ( s, Actors.none )
  |]
```
